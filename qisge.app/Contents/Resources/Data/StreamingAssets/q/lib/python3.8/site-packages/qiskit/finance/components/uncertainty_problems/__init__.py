Uncertainty Problems (:mod:`qiskit.finance.components.uncertainty_problems`)
============================================================================
These are finance specific Aqua Uncertainty Problems where they inherit from
Aqua :class:`~qiskit.aqua.components.uncertainty_problems.UncertaintyProblem`.
Because they rely on finance specific knowledge and/or functions they are
located here rather than in Aqua.
