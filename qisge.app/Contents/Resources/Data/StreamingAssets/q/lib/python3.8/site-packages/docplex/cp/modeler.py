"""
This module contains the functions that allows to construct all operations
and constraints that can be used in a *CP Optimizer* model.

There is one Python function per *CP Optimizer* operation or constraint.
As many operations have multiple combinations of parameters,
the functions of this module are generally declared with a variable number
of arguments.
The valid combinations are detailed in the description of the function.

Following is the list of textual expressions used to identify the different data types that
are used by the modeling methods:

 * *integer expression* represents any integer expression including integer constants, integer variables, and
   modeling operations that take only integer expressions as arguments.
 * *boolean expression* represents a logical value true or false.
   It can be used as integer expressions, with value 1 for true, and 0 for false.
 * *float expression* represents any floating point expression, including float constants, integer expressions, and
   modeling operations that take at least one float expression as argument.
 * *array of xxxx expression* represents a Python list or tuple of *xxxx expression*.
 * *constraint expression* is an expression that can not be used as an argument of another expression.
 * *cumul expression* is an expression that represents the sum of individual contributions of intervals.

In the following, the different modeling functions are briefly presented.

**Cumulative expressions**

A cumul function expression is an expression whose value in a solution is a function from the set of integers
to the set of non-negative integers.
A cumul function expression represents the sum of individual contributions of intervals.
A panel of elementary cumul function expressions is available to describe the individual contribution of
an interval variable (or a fixed interval) to a cumul function expression:

 * A pulse function is an elementary function defined by an interval variable (or a fixed interval) whose value is
   equal to 0 outside the interval and equal to a non-negative constant on the interval.
   This value is called the height of the pulse function.
 * A step function is an elementary function defined by one of the end-points of an interval variable
   (its start or end) whose value is equal to 0 before this end-point and equal to a non-negative constant
   after the end-point.
   This value is called the height of the step function.
 * A cumul function expression is defined as the sum of the above elementary functions or their opposite.
   Several constraints over cumul function expressions are provided.
   These constraints allow restricting the possible values of the function over the complete horizon or over
   some fixed or variable interval:

Available methods are:

 * :meth:`pulse`: Elementary cumul function of constant value between the start and the end of an interval.
 * :meth:`step_at`: Elementary cumul function of constant value after a given point.
 * :meth:`step_at_start`: Elementary cumul function of constant value after the start of an interval.
 * :meth:`step_at_end`: Elementary cumul function of constant value after the end of an interval.
 * :meth:`height_at_start`: Contribution of an interval variable to a cumul function at its start point.
 * :meth:`height_at_end`: Contribution of an interval variable to a cumul function at its end point.
 * :meth:`always_in`: Restrict the possible values of a cumul expression (or a state function) to a particular range
 * :meth:`cumul_range`: Limits the range of a cumul function expression.

**State functions**

A state function is a decision variable whose value is a set of non-overlapping intervals over which the
function maintains a particular non-negative integer state.
In between those intervals, the state of the function is not defined, typically because of an ongoing
transition between two states.

A set of constraints are available to restrict the evolution of a state function:

 * :meth:`always_in`: Restrict the possible values of a state function (or a cumul expression) to a particular range.
 * :meth:`always_no_state`: Ensures that a state function is undefined on an interval.
 * :meth:`always_constant`: Ensures a constant state for a state function on an interval.
 * :meth:`always_equal`: Fixes a given state for a state function during a variable or fixed interval.

Search phases
-------------

**Variable evaluators**

An evaluator of integer variables is an object that is used by selectors of variables to define instantiation strategies.

 * :meth:`domain_size`: Number of elements in the current domain of the variable chosen by the search.
 * :meth:`domain_max`: Maximum value in the current domain of the variable chosen by the search.
 * :meth:`domain_min`: Minimum value in the current domain of the variable chosen by the search.
 * :meth:`var_impact`: Average reduction of the search space of the variable chosen by the search.
 * :meth:`var_local_impact`: Impact of the variable computed at the current node of the search tree.
 * :meth:`var_index`: Index of the variable in an array of variables.
 * :meth:`var_success_rate`: Success rate of the variable.
 * :meth:`impact_of_last_branch`: Domain reduction that the last instantiation made by search has achieved on the evaluated variable.
 * :meth:`explicit_var_eval`: Variable evaluator that gives an explicit value to variables.

**Value evaluators**

An evaluator of integer values is an object that is used by value selectors to define instantiation strategies.

 * :meth:`value`: Returns as evaluation the value itself.
 * :meth:`value_impact`: Average reduction of the search space observed so far when instantiating the selected variable to the evaluated value.
 * :meth:`value_success_rate`: Success rate of instantiating the selected variable to the evaluated value.
 * :meth:`value_index`: Index of the value in an array of integer values.
 * :meth:`explicit_value_eval`: Gives an explicit evaluation to values.

**Variable selectors**

A selector of integer variables is used by variable choosers to define search strategies.

 * :meth:`select_smallest`: Selector of integer variables having the smallest evaluation according to a given evaluator.
 * :meth:`select_largest`: Selector of integer variables having the largest evaluation according to a given evaluator.
 * :meth:`select_random_var`: Selector of integer variables that selects a variable randomly.

**Value selectors**

A selector of integer values is used by value choosers to define search strategies.

    The *pack* constraint is used to represent sub-problems where the requirement is to assign objects to

    Let's assume we have *n* objects and *m* containers.
    The sizes of the array arguments of *pack* must correspond to these constants,
    that is *load* must be of size *m*, whereas *where* and *size* must be of size *n*.
    Given assignments to the *where* expressions, the *pack* constraint will calculate the values of
    the *load* and *used* expressions.

    All counting is done from 0, and so the interpretation of 5 being assigned to *where[3]* is that object 3
    (the 4th object) is placed into container 5 (the 6th container).

    of the value of *load[5]*.

    Naturally, all the arguments (with the exception of *size*) can be constrained by additional constraints.
    The most common form is to limit the capacity of a container.
    For example, to limit container 2 to a capacity of 15, one would write *load[2] <= 15*.
    Minimum fill level requirements can also be specified this way: for example *load[2] >= 12*.
    Other more esoteric constraints are possible, for example to say that only an even number of containers

#--- Search phase -------------------------------------------------------------

def search_phase(vars=None, varchooser=None, valuechooser=None):

     * a variable chooser that defines how the next variable to instantiate is chosen
     * a value chooser that defines how values are chosen when instantiating variables.

    The embedded search strategy, determined by the value of the solver parameter *SearchType*,
    will use the search phases to instantiate the variables for which a search phase is specified.

    Several search phases can be given to the CP model using method :meth:`docplex.cp.model.CpoModel.set_search_phases`
    or :meth:`docplex.cp.model.CpoModel.add_search_phase`.

    The order of the search phases in the array is important. In the CP search strategy, the variables will be
    instantiated phase by phase starting by the first phase of the array.
    It is not necessary that the variables in the search phases cover all the variables of the problem.
    It can be assumed that a search phase containing all the problem variables is implicitly added to the
    end of the given array of search phases.

    A search phase can be created with an array of variables only.
    The embedded search will then choose an instantiation strategy automatically.
    For instance, assuming that x and y are arrays of integer variables, the following code:
    ::

        mdl.set_search_phases([search_phase(x), search_phase(y)])

    indicates to CP search that variables from the array x must be instantiated before those from the array y.
    The way to instantiate them will be chosen by CP search.

    Similarly, it is not necessary to specify an array of variables to a search phase.
    A search phase defined this way will be applied to every integer variable extracted from the model.

        vars (Optional): Array of integer, interval or sequence variables.
